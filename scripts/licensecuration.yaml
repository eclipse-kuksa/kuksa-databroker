components:
  # ring is based on the standard OpenSSL and BoringSSL
  # projects, thus licensing of the codebase is complex depending
  # on parts. This makes sure that except the explanatory text
  # in ring (and thus in the generated CycloneDX file) are copied
  # as well as the vanilla text of the ISC and OPENSSL license
  # OpenSSL seems to be in the process to move to Apache-2.0, but this
  # may take some time
  ring:
    expression: "ring AND ISC AND OPENSSL"


expressions:
    # LLVM exception not relevant for the project, thus in situation
    # like this we choose to use vanilla Apache-2.0 terms
    "Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception OR Apache-2.0 OR MIT": "Apache-2.0"
