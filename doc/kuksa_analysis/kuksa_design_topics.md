# Data availability/persistence according to lifecycle of Client, Databroker and Provider
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
      1. Databroker stores last signal values during its own lifecycle.
      2. It is not possible to reset values.
      3. Signal Consumer and Provider are not aware of each other.

    Description:
   1. The data broker either ...
      * Stores last set values during its own lifecycle,
      * Stores values during the system's power cycle (i.e., "persists" values over own restarts, or
      * store values over system's power cycles.

   2. How to "reset" values availability if its provider got inactive (without reseting the value)?
      * -> Client's job (e.g. using timestamp)?
      * -> Broker's job (e.g. using timestamp + minimal update cycle)?

   3. Provider and client aliveness
      * If there is no active client subscription should the provider stop sending values to Databroker?
      * If there is no active provider setting values while client subscription? Should Databroker or Client be aware of it?

# Wildcard support
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions:
      Only `ListMetadata` support wildcard due to complex error handling in the implementation and usability.
      Also due to performance issues, i.e when calling `subscribe` since the wildcard was checked for each path and each response.
    Description:
 * Do we want it only for `GetMetadata`?

Reference -> [Wildcard](../wildcard_matching.md)

# Registration of Datapoints
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions:
      Provider can register and claim only actuators.
      An actuator can only by claimed by a Provider.
    Description:
Do we need a method for providers to register data points at runtime? **Implemented in old API?**:

Its purpose would be:
1.	Publishing the availability of new data points during runtime
2.	Claiming providership of those data points


In a mature system some "central instance", e.g., the system integrator must be responsible to ensure that no two components can register/claim providership for any data point.
In case of a registration method the central instance would either have to
  * make sure there is single provider per data point via configuration, or
  * use access rights management to enforce that only the right component can register a certain data point.


# Availability of Datapoints
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
1. The system must be capable of individually checking the availability of each data point on a specific instance of the data broker. This means verifying whether there is an active provider instance installed on the system where the data broker instance is running, which is capable of supplying the data point during the current update cycle.

2. It shall be possible to determine the availability of the actual value of each data point separately on a certain instance of the data broker.
This represents the information if the provider of that data point is up and running on the system and already provided a value of that data point.


# Lifecycle of components
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Kuksa.val.v2 API as well as Databroker implementation does not depend on any certain order of starting for components.
      Important point -> Signal Consumer and Provider should implement a retry policy in case connection get lots.
    Description:
The proper function of the overall system of components "around" the data broker, i.e., applications, providers, and the broker itself, shall not depend on a certain order of starting the components. This means:
1.	Any clients of the data broker (applications, providers) shall not assume the availability of the data broker service when they startup.
2.	Any clients of the data broker (applications, providers) shall not assume the permanent availability of the data broker service during their runtime.
3.	Any applications/clients shall not assume the availability of a value for any data point at their startup.
4.	Any applications/clients shall not assume the permanent presence of a value for any data point during their runtime.
Explanation: Any component of the system can come and go - components could stop working due to a crash (what should not but will happen) or because of an update (which is a regular use case). Furthermore, components could reside on different execution environments which need restarts at different points of time. This shall not result in stopping and restarting the overall system. Instead, each and every component shall react in an appropriate way on changing availability of its dependencies.

# Path requests
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Databroker fully supports VSS
    Description:
The Databroker shall support at least those metadata elements as defined by the VSS rule set. Data points/nodes are (primarily) identified ("addressed") by their name/path which is a string.
VSS arranges nodes in a tree structure, separating elements via a single dot ("."). This shall be supported but must not be a mandatory requirement.
```console
  Vehicle.Speed;
  Vehicle.Seats.Row1.Position;
  ...
```

# Errors
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Kuksa.val.v2 API as well as Databroker implementation is consistent and it is aligned by all service calls
      returning [gRPC Error](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html).
    Description:
Error response returned by **all gRPC service calls** must be a aligned with [gRPC Error](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html).
```protobuf
message Status {
  // The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code].
  int32 code = 1;

  // A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
  // user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
  // [google.rpc.Status.details][google.rpc.Status.details] field, or localized by the client.
  string message = 2;

  // A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
  // common set of message types for APIs to use.
  repeated google.protobuf.Any details = 3;
}
```
Field `details` of type `Any` will be a serialized message as `bytes` containing an internal Databroker [Error](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker/blob/main/proto/kuksa/val/v1/types.proto#L246):
```protobuf
message Error {
  uint32 code    = 1;
  string reason  = 2;
  string message = 3;
}
```

# Setting Values
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions:
    Description:
1. Attributes:
   * It shall not be possible to set attribute values, except once at startup time by its respective responsible provider.
2. Sensors:
   * There shall be only one client able to set the current sensor value during each arbitrary span of time.
3. Actuators:
   * ? Actuator data points have a current and a target value. The current value represents the actual state of the actuator, whereas the target value represents a state desired by that client, who most recently set that target value.
   * Only one client shall be able to set the current actuator value during each arbitrary span of time. This client is the provider of the data point.
   * Multiple client may be able to set the target value of an actuator.
   * Only the current provider client shall react on setting a new target value. It is expected that the provider tries to bring the current state of an actuator into the state requested by the target value. If this is not possible (for some reason), the provider is responsible to reset the state of the target value to that of the current value of the same data point.
     -> This actually not a requirement to the data broker, but to the overall "usage concept" around the broker.
   *? If no (active) provider is available for an actuator data point, its current and target value shall be "unavailable". A set request to a target value shall be "ignored" and the resulting target and current value shall stay as "unavailable".

# Atomic operatoins
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Kuksa.val.v2 API as well as Databroker implementation supports atomic operations handling sequentially request and responses for all the service methods.
    Description:
All data point values set by a single request must be updated in an atomic manner. This means:
1. Set requests must be handled strongly sequentially in the order of reception.

2. Responses to get requests and notifications on behalf of active subscriptions must represent the state of data points in-between finished set requests, i.e., a single set request (updating multiple data points) must not be interfered with get requests or update notifications.

# Update notifications
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Databroker implementation will only receive datapoints when their values changed.
    Description:
1. Update notifications for active subscriptions of multiple data points shall always contain the state of all data points of the subscription even if just one value has changed.

2. If this behavior is not wanted by a client, it must subscribe data points separately.

# Access rights
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions:
      1. Many Providers can update a sensor at same time, just the last value will remain on Databroker database.
      2. Many Signal Consumers can change the value of an actuator, but only a Provider will forward its value to the Vehicle Network.
      3. New actuators values will be forwarded from Signal Consumer to Databroker to Provider to Vehicle Network, but Databroker will not be responsible for resetting any value on its Database, just fire and forget.
    Description:
1.	Sensor (-like) data points: Its value shall be set be a single provider only (at least at a time)

2.	Actuator (-like) data points: Multiple clients may set its (target) value, a single client may act on its last set (target) value and "reset" it. Only a single client must set its current value (if there is a distinguishing).
Hint: This does not necessarily need to ensured via the "API design" - it could also be ensured via access rights management configuration.


# VSS signals - Users vs providers
    Status: 游릭/游리
    Current decisions: New Databroker API kuksa.val.v2 will only have one service which will be used as entry point for Signal Consumer and Provider, it does not mean that it can not change in the future.
    Description:
The Vehicle Signals Specification (VSS) and Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) describes the standardized signals available (or not) in a vehicle. Both standards also describe how users interact with these signals.

* They can read and subscribe to [actuators, sensors](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/data_entry/sensor_actuator/) and[attributes](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/data_entry/sensor_actuator/).
* They can set [actuators](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/data_entry/sensor_actuator/).) (and only actuators).
  For VISSv2 specifically, see ([read](https://w3c.github.io/automotive/spec/VISSv2_Core.html#read), [subscribe](https://w3c.github.io/automotive/spec/VISSv2_Core.html#subscribe)), [update](https://w3c.github.io/automotive/spec/VISSv2_Core.html#update))).

VSS and VISS does _not_맙pecify how signals are provided _into_ the VSS server / model.

These two aspects of interacting with the signals can thus be divided into:
* **Provider**<br>
  _A provider is providing a signal (sensor, attribute or actuator) to the VSS tree._<br>
  _A provider can also use signals as any other user._

* **User**<br>
  _A user (or client) is using the signals in the VSS tree (without providing any of them itself)._

where the VSS and VISS* specifications only specify the **User** part.

When designing the databroker API, the method kuksa.val uses for providing signals was investigated. In short, kuksa-val-server takes the approach of trying to shoehorn the need of signal providers into the existing VISSv2 protocol. This is problematic for several reasons:

* By reusing, **but changing the meaning** of the terminology used in VSS, there is a constant dissonance between the terms used. This is a recipe for confusion.
* By deviating from the standard in _this particular way_, a standards compliant VISSv2 client cannot use it in any meaningful way.
* It makes it harder to actually provide a standards compliant VISSv2 in the future .
* By using the same methods for both signal providers _and_ users of signals it's harder (or impossible) to customize them for their different requirements.

With this in mind, databroker chose to make a clear distinction between signal providers and signal users. It doesn't use this terminology though. It does this by splitting the interface into two separate services, which are customized for their different requirements / use cases. It doesn't need to be implemented in this way in order to achieve the same design goal, though.

# Enable "easy to use" user facing API
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions:
      With the new design of kuksa.val.v2 this use case get solved by just "fire and forget" new actuator values.
      Use case:
        The user wants to lock a door and know when it's done / whether it worked.
        1. User calls `subscribe(Vehicle.Door.Locked)`
        2. User calls `actuate(Vehicle.Door.Locked, true)`
        3. Provider receives the request and starts forwards the request to the Vehicle Network.
        4. Provider at some point in time receives a new value for Vehicle.Door.Locked signal from the Vehicle Network.
        5. Provider publishes the new value to Databroker.
        6. User receives a new changed value for Vehicle.Door.Locked and concludes that the door has now been locked.

      Note: User should define its own timeout for each application in case the actuate value expected is not received.

      Or if there are no providers.
        1. User calls `subscribe(Vehicle.Door.Locked)`
        2. User calls `actuate(Vehicle.Door.Locked, true)`
        3. Databroker returns an error when no available provider has claimed the actuator signal.
    Description:
This is meant to illustrate what type of user APIs that can be created depending on what the provider API looks like (assuming we have one).

Use case:

The user wants to lock a door and know when it's done / whether it worked.

**The kuksa.val.v1 or "key-value store" way.**

Something conceptually like this:
1. User calls `set(Vehicle.Door.Locked, field=TARGET_VALUE, true)`
2. User calls `subscribe(Vehicle.Door.Locked, field=VALUE)`
3. Provider (subscribing to TARGET_VALUE) receives the request and starts actuating, providing VALUE when it changes.
4. User is notified when VALUE turns to true, and concludes that the door has now been locked.

But what happens if the door fails to lock, e.g. the door is not close or the actuator is broken?
* What should the user subscribe to for this information?
* And how long should it wait before concluding that it failed?
* And what happens if there is no provider of this actuator?

Another question, a bit convoluted for a quick actuator like this (but applicable for slower moving things), is happens if another user calls set(..., false) before the actuator change has taken place?

This can be solved by subscribing to both VALUE and TARGET_VALUE.

1. User calls `set(Vehicle.Door.Locked, field=TARGET_VALUE, true)`
2. User calls `subscribe(Vehicle.Door.Locked, fields=[VALUE, TARGET_VALUE])`
3. Provider (subscribing to TARGET_VALUE) receives the request and starts actuating, providing VALUE when it changes.
4. User is notified when VALUE turns true, and concludes that the door has now been locked, or the user is notified when TARGET_VALUE turns false, and knows that the operation was cancelled.


**The user API + provider API way.**

So what could this look like if we instead had an "easy to use" user API + a provider API and the server in between.

Something like this:
1. User calls `set(Vehicle.Door.Locked, true)`
2. Server receives the request and sends an ACTUATOR_TARGET value to the provider of this signal.
3. The provider receives it and starts actuating and provides VALUE back to the server when it changes.
4. The provider sends "actuator target reached" back to the server.
5. The server sends a (success) response back to the client.

Or in case of failure:

User calls `set(Vehicle.Door.Locked, true)`
1. Server receives the request and sends an ACTUATOR_TARGET value to the provider of this signal.
2. The provider receives it and starts actuating but notice that it fails, or that it's not allowed at the moment.
3. The provider sends "actuator failed" or something back.
4. The server sends a response "actuator failed" back to the client.

Or if there are no providers.
1. User calls `set(Vehicle.Door.Locked, true)`.
2. The server knows that there are no providers, providing that signal.
3. The server sends a response "actuator failed" or "not available" back to the client

This latter approach would seem to represent an easier to use API for the user/library.

**Note**
Doing it like this puts the requirement to know the details of the actuator on the actuator provider.

The actuator provider is better suited to know of reasonable timeouts etc in comparison to the users of signals (or the server). The user doesn't need to know how long to wait for something or to which error to subscribe. The server would only have to handle the presence detection which is a generic feature that doesn't require knowledge of sensor specifics.



# Performance / runtime footprint
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: A detailed performance report will be provided after release of kuksa.val.v2. So far kuksa.val.v2 shows better performance than kuksa.val.v1 and sdv.databroker.v1
    Description:
Providers, especially of sensor data, are often setting values in rapid succession over long periods of time. Using unary GRPC calls for `Set` operations, is less efficient in terms of throughput when compared to GRPC streams. It's also more CPU intensive.

The current design of `kuksa.val.v1` only provides unary call to set values. This represents a pure regression when compared to the databroker API.

It's not a huge issue (in practice) if users avoid using `kuksa_client.KuksaClientThread()`. If they use that, I would say it's barely usable for e.g. CAN in it's current form.

**Python performance setting signal values**

| Set only                    | type  |    throughput  |
|-----------------------------|-------|---------------:|
| kuksa_client <sup>(1)</sup> |       |   ~     80 / s |
| kuksa.grpc   <sup>(2)</sup> | async |   ~  2 500 / s |
| kuksa.val.v1 <sup>(3)</sup> | async |   ~  6 500 / s |
| kuksa.val.v1 <sup>(3)</sup> | sync  |   ~  9 000 / s |
| databroker   <sup>(4)</sup> | sync  |   ~ 26 000 / s |

<sup>1</sup> kuksa_client is using `kuksa_client.KuksaClientThread()`

<sup>2</sup> kuksa.grpc is using `kuksa_client.grpc` without the legacy `kuksa_client.KuksaClientThread()` wrapping it

<sup>3</sup> uses the generated `val_pb2*.py` python lib directly

<sup>4</sup> uses the generated `collector_pb2*.py` python lib directly


Improvements:
* Higher throughput.
* Reduced CPU load.
* Lower latency (probably, hasn't been measured)

What's needed:
* Introduce a streaming (GRPC) interface for providing sensor data.

# Throttling-mode when system is overloaded.
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
Is it worth to consider some throttling mode to be activated by the user in case system or any component is overloaded?
Throttling modes to think about:
  * Rate Limiting
  * Bandwidth Throttling
  * CPU Throttling

# Considerations regarding shared and zero-copy memory approaches
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
Pros:
Cons:

# Provider control and provider capabilities
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
Open questions:

Should the "change type" of a sensor (i.e. CONTINUOUS vs ON_CHANGE) be decided by providers
or in the VSS metadata?
It only makes sense for consumers to request their preferred rate of updates when they are
subscribing to a sensor of type CONTINUOUS. That would be an argument for providing this
information as part of the VSS metadata, so that it doesn't vary between vehicles.

# Control the rate of updates
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
Users of (continuous) sensor data can have different preferences with regard to how often
they would like to receive updates. E.g. Vehicle.Speed is updated 100 times per second, but
a consumer would only need it 1 time per second. This would introduce unnecessary processing
requirements on the consumer (and provider).

Currently there is no way for databroker to know how often a provider should provide updates.
There is also no way for clients to instruct databroker of what rate they want.
Sensor data is just sent at the rate it is received and providers are just sending sensor data at the rate
they themselves decide.

If a consumer can communicate this wish, there are several options for improvement.

Improvements:
* Reduction in load for consumers by adapting the update rate based on their preferences.
* Reduction in load for for providers by propagating needed update rate.
* Reduction in load for databroker by disabling unneeded providers.

What's needed:
* Introduce a way for clients to tell databroker of their preferred rate of updates.
* Introduce a way for databroker to tell providers of highest needed frequency of sensor
  data to which they can then adapt.
  [probably needs] open stream `databroker` -> `provider`

Other considerations:

Setting the desired rate of update would only make sense for sensors of type CONTINUOUS.
Sensors of type ON_CHANGE would always provide updates when the value changes.
It could also make sense to introduce a way to request a momentary value from a provider,
which would be used if a consumer only requests a momentary value (and doesn't subscribe).


# Differentiate between different providers of the same VSS data
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
Different sensors can provide data that is mapped to the same VSS signal / entry.
This data can be of different resolution and / or quality. For example, an accelerometer
can be used to infer the current speed of a vehicle, but a speedometer would probably
provide a higher quality measurement. In the same way that a consumer could instruct
databroker of a preferred update rate, it could also instruct the databroker of what
accuracy of a sensor it needs.

It's currently possible for multiple providers to set the same VSS entry, but there is no
way for databroker to differentiate between them in any way.

It could make sense to introduce a way for providers to describe themselves in order to
make it possible to differentiate between them with regard to update rates, power consumption, accuracy or quality of their sensor data.

This would give databroker the clients a way to to differentiate (and choose) different
sources of data and make informed decisions based on that.

Improvements:
* Choose between providers based on available update frequency.
* Fallback when sensor information from one sensor isn't available.

What's needed:
* Introduce a way for providers to describe their capabilities and properties of their
  provided sensor data.

Optional improvements:
* Choose between providers based on needed quality / accuracy of sensor.
  [needs] control plane, i.e. an open stream `databroker` -> `provider`
* Consumers can get extended sensor data information.

Optionally needed:
* Introduce a way for consumers to tell databroker of their needed quality / accuracy
  of VSS signal.


# Data Aliveness/Availability
    Status: 游댮
    Current decisions:
    Description:
The VSS signals / datapoints that are accessed through databroker can have a value and a
timestamp. If they have never been set, they will have neither.

There is no way for databroker to know if a value is up to date or not, since it doesn't
have any information with regard to how often it should be updated or a way to determine
if a provider has stopped providing data.

For signals with a fixed update rate (sensors of type CONTINUOUS), it would theoretically
be possible for either clients or the databroker to determine if a signal is up to date,
by keeping track of the time since the last update.

The providers of sensor data would be better suited to know the rate of update, and if
the databroker where provided this information, it could automatically determine if a
sensor hasn't been update within it's expected time window.

For signals that only update based on events (i.e. a door opens), this isn't possible.
Tracking the liveness of these signals would either require the providers to continuously
send the same value even though it hasn't changed, or to have an open connection or
another heartbeat mechanism between databroker and the provider to detect a missing provider.

If there was a way to determine the availability of providers, the databroker could
automatically determine that a signal was stale if it's provider is no longer available.

Improvements:
* Track availability / liveness of a VSS signals.

What's needed:
* Introduce a way to signal that a signal is available / not available (in `kuksa.val.v1`).
* Introduce a way for providers to tell databroker of a signals time to live (TTL).
* Introduce a way for databroker to track availability of providers (and which VSS signals
  they are providing).
  [needs] an open stream `provider` -> `databroker` or `databroker` -> `provider`
* Implement tracking of TTL in databroker to automatically set unavailable status to signals
  that have not been updated in time.


Other considerations:
Attributes probably don't need to have aliveness functionality. They would be
unavailable if they have never been set, but since they shouldn't update at runtime,
once set they should be valid indefinitely.


# Missing features from `sdv.databroker.v1` in `kuksa.val.v1`
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: New API kuksa.val.v2 will cover and combine feature from both APIs.
    Description:
Sort list: What features would be lost if removing sdv.databroker.v1 today
 * Registration of new datapoints
 * SQL queries
 * Streaming updates (i.e. worse performance)
 * Connectivity check (no streaming interface)


# Exploring a design of a bidirectional streaming API
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: New bidirectional streaming service method was added to `kuksa.val.v2`
      SensorCommand (start/stop) should be implemented at some point.游리
    Description:
This represent one way to design an interface that would enable most of the improvements
listed above and provide a clear path forward for introducing them.


## Design choices

In this design, a single bidirection stream is used to provide everything needed by
providers:
`rpc Provide(stream ProviderRequest) returns (stream ProviderResponse);`

This combines the control channel and the data channel into one. An alternative
would be to split it into two bidirectional streams, one for control and the other
for data. I'm not sure which makes the most sense.

#### Stream
By having an open stream (at all) between databroker and the provider, both ends
can detect if the other goes away.

Furthermore:

A stream from provider -> databroker:
- Enables higher throughput for sensor data updates and lower CPU usage.

A stream from databroker -> provider:
- Provides a way for databroker to send control commands to this provider.
- Provides a way for databroker to send errors to this provider.

#### Bidirectional stream

A bidirectional stream between Provider <-> databroker
- Provides databroker with a way to associate information sent from the provider
  (e.g. capabilities, which actuators it provides, which sensors etc) with the stream
  it uses to control it.

#### Actuators
VSS defines three types of signals:
* Attribute
* Sensor
* Actuator

An actuator acts as both something you can actuate and something providing values (a sensor).
It's not even necessarily the same component providing the implementation of these separate concerns. With this in mind, a provider providing an VSS actuator would in this design provide
an `Actuator(path)` to the server in order to receive `ActuateCommand`s, and provide
`Sensor(path)` and send `SensorData` when they are providing sensor data.

The alternative would be to duplicate everything in `Sensor` for `Actuator`s.


## Overview
The stream in each direction would consist of different "messages" implemented with `oneof {...}`.

In the direction of *Provider -> Server*, at least three types of "messages" would flow<sup>(2)</sup>:
* `SensorData` containing data streamed by the provider.
* `Sensor` containing sensor information from the provider.
* `Actuator` containing actuator information from the provider.
* `Attribute` containing attribute including the value. <sup>(1)</sup>

In the direction of *Server -> Provider*, at least three types of "messages" would flow:
* `ActuateCommand`, tells actuator to actuate (triggered by someone setting actuator targets).
* `SensorCommand`, controls behaviour of a sensor, i.e.
   "start", "stop", "try to use this update frequency" etc..
* `Error`, an error occurred. One type at the moment. It would probably make sense to
   split it into errors that can occur at any time & errors that are directly caused by
   things the provider provided.

<sup>(1)</sup> It would probably make sense to introduce a separate `Error` in the direction of
    *Provider -> Server*. Currently, the only errors in that direction is `ReadError` as part of the
    sensor data.

<sup>(2)</sup> It's possible that it makes mores sense to provide a separate unary RPC call for setting attributes,
    since attributes (probably) don't update frequently and (probably) wont need availability status etc..

```proto
service VAL {
  ...
  rpc Provide(stream ProviderRequest) returns (stream ProviderResponse);
}

message ProviderRequest {
  oneof provide {
    Sensor sensor = 1;
    Actuator actuator = 2;
    Attribute attribute = 3;
    SensorData sensor_data = 4;
  }
}

message ProviderResponse {
  oneof command {
    ActuateCommand actuator_command = 1;
    SensorCommand sensor_command = 2;
    Error error = 3;
  }
}

...

```


# message Datapoint
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Alternative 1 was selected for development since `value` it is easy to access and in Protobuf could be `None`, meaning signal exists but does not have a value at the moment.
    Description:
Suggestion -> https://github.com/boschglobal/kuksa-databroker/pull/4#discussion_r1766459917

Discussion -> https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker/pull/33#discussion_r1776993874

### Alternative 1
```proto
message Datapoint {
    google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 1;
    Value value   = 1;
}
```
pros : easy to access value

cons : no possible value status/state

### Alternative 2
```proto
message Datapoint {
  google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 1;

  oneof value_state {
    State state = 2;
    Value value = 3;
  }
}

enum State {
    // Unspecified value failure, reserved for gRPC backwards compatibility
    // (see https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/dos-donts/#unspecified-enum)
    UNSPECIFIED    = 0;
    // The signal is known and provided, but doesn't have a valid value
    INVALID_VALUE  = 1;
    // The signal is known, but no value is provided currently
    NOT_PROVIDED   = 2;
}
```

pros : easy to understand

cons : "more difficult to implement" depend on programming language

### Alternative 3
```proto
message Datapoint {
    google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 1;

    Status status = 2;
    Value value   = 3;
}

enum Status {
    STATUS_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    STATUS_OK = 1;
    STATUS_VALUE_NOT_AVAILBLE = 2;
}
```

pros : easy to understand and access

cons : Difficult to keep consistency between `status` and `value` values.

# Split subscribe method due to performance reasons
    Status: 游릭
    Current decisions: Implemented
    Description:
  Before:
  rpc Subscribe(SubscribeRequest) returns (stream SubscribeResponse); -> Signal_ID (path, id)


  Now:
  rpc Subscribe(SubscribeRequest) returns (stream SubscribeResponse); -> strings path

  rpc SubscribeId(SubscribeRequestId) returns (stream SubscribeResponseId); -> int32 path -> faster


message SubscribeByIdResponse {
  map<int32, Datapoint> entries = 1;
  //map<int32, Notification> entries = 1; // add to discussion PR
}
