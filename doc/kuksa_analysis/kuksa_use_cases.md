# Use cases:

## UC1
    Title: Get sensor values.

    Status: 游릭

    Description: Signal consumer gets sensor and actuator values of signals.

**Primary Actor:** Signal consumer

**Secondary Actors:** Databroker, Provider, Vehicle Network

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
 * Provider can read from Vehicle Network.
 * Signal Consumer contains a valid authentication token to connect and perform calls to Databroker.
 * Provider should have published some signal values to Databroker before calling GetValues.

**Special requirements:**

**Assumptions:**
* Singal Consumer should get exactly all signal values requested.

**Postconditions:**
* Signal Consumer receives a vector with all signals requested in same order as requested.

**Sequence diagram:**
![Signal Consumer](../diagrams/consumer_get_values.svg)

**Basic Flow:**
1.  Provider opens bidirectional stream and sends a claim actuators request.
2.  Databroker stores the claim request.
3.  Provider starts publishing at a high frequency sensor and actuator values as soon as received from Vehicle network.
4.  Signal Consumer calls GetValues with signal paths.
5.  Databroker sends the response with signal values back to the Signal Consumer.
9.	Use case finishes.

**Secondary Actors:** Databroker, Provider, Vehicle Network

**Priority**: High

**Preconditions:**
 * Signal Consumer contains a valid authentication token to connect and perform calls to databroker.

**Special requirements:**
 * The use case must meet a high frequency notification rate.

**Assumptions:**
 * Signal Consumer subscribes to all possible sensor and actuator values.
 * Provider porvides signals values to Databroker as fast as receives data from the Vehicle Network.

**Postconditions:**
 * A subscription is created, and Signal Consumer receives streaming of signals.

**Sequence diagram:**

![Signal Consumer Subscribes](../diagrams/consumer_subscribes.svg)

**Basic Flow:**
1.  Provider opens bidirectional stream and sends a claim actuators request.
2.  Databroker stores the claim request.
3.  Provider start publishing at high frequency sensor and actuator values received from Vehicle network.
4.  Signal Consumer calls list metadata to get all signals ids:
5.  Signal Consumer subscribes to all the sensor and actuator values by their ids.
6.  Databroker sends the current values stream back to the Signal Consumer.
7.  Databroker receives from Provider the new signal values and update its database.
8.  Databroker sends the changed values stream back to the Signal Consumer.
8.	Signal Consumer closes subscription to Databroker.
9.	Use case finishes.

**Exceptions:**


## UC3
    Title: Signal Consumer actuates on an actuator.

    Status: 游릭

    Description: Signal Consumer actuates on an actuator.

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
 * Signal Consumer contains a valid authentication token to connect and perform calls to databroker.

**Special requirements:**

**Assumptions:**
 * Databroker send ACK response back to Signal Consumer as soon as the request was forwarded by Provider to Vehicle Network.
 * It does not necessarily mean that the actuator succesfully updated its value to the desired new value.

**Postconditions:**
 * Signal Consumer receives a response which indicates the operation was successfully forwarded.
 * Provider can read and write from Vehicle Network.

**Sequence diagram:**
![Signal Consumer Actuate](../diagrams/consumer_actuate.svg)

1.  Provider opens bidirectional stream and sends a claim actuators request.
2.  Databroker stores the claim request.
3.  Provider start publishing at high frequency sensor and actuator values received from Vehicle network.
4.  Signal Consumer calls actuate with new actuator value.
5.  Databroker forwards the request to the corresponding provider.
6.  Provider sends the actuation request to the Vehicle Network.
7.  Provider sends ack response back to Databroker.
8.  Databroker sends ack response back to the Signal Consumer.
9.	Use case finishes.


**Exceptions:**


## UC4

**Special requirements:**

**Assumptions:**

**Postconditions:**
 * Signal Consumer receives a response which indicates the operation was successfully forwarded.
 * Provider can read and write from Vehicle Network.

**Sequence diagram:**
![Signal Consumer Actuate](../diagrams/consumer_actuate_multiple_providers.svg)
