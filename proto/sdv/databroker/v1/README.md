# sdv.databroker.v1 protobuf API

This directory contain a Protobuf API supported by KUKSA Databroker.

To enable the legacy `sdv.databroker.v1` API you must start Databroker with the `--enable-databroker-v1` argument.

This API is deprecated. It is recommended to use
the [kuksa.val.v2](../../../kuksa/val/v2/val.proto).

# Schema documentation

The schema documentation is auto generated by `protoc` and the `protoc-gen-doc` [plugin](https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc) and can be found for
[interactions between provider and broker](./sdv-collector.md) and [interactions between consumer and broker](./sdv-broker.md)
